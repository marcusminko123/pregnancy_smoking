### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(tidymodels)
library(openintro)
data(ncbirths)
view(ncbirths)
?ncbirths
```
### Vizualize the proportion of low birth weight birth by smoking status of the mother
```{r birth weight}


ncbirths %>% 
       ggplot(aes(x = lowbirthweight)) + geom_bar() + facet_wrap(~habit)

#Need to remove the missing values 

ncbirths <- na.omit(ncbirths)

#Recreate the visualization with labels and free scales

ncbirths %>% 
           ggplot(aes(x = lowbirthweight)) + geom_bar(fill = "steel blue") + facet_wrap(~habit, scales = "free") + labs(title = "Does Smoking Impact a Low Birth Weight", x = "Low Birth Weight", y = "Frequency") + theme_minimal()

# you can see that there is a greater proportion of low birth weights among smokers
